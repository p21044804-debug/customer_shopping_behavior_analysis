# **Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis — End-to-End Data Analytics Project**

## 📌 **Overview**

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow — from raw data to business insights.
It includes Python-based data cleaning and EDA, SQL analysis using PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server, interactive Power BI dashboards, and final business reporting using Gamma.

The goal is to understand customer demographics, purchasing behavior, product preferences, shipping choices, and subscription patterns.

## 📊 **Dataset**

* **Rows:** ~3,900 transactions
* **Columns:** 15–18 features
* Includes:

  * Customer demographics (age, gender, location)
  * Purchase details (item, category, amount, season)
  * Behavior metrics (previous purchases, discounts, subscription status)

> Dataset loaded using Python (Pandas) for cleaning and preparation before exporting to SQL.

## 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**

* **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Databases:** PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server
* **Power BI:** Dashboard & data visualization
* **Gamma:** Final presentation
* **Jupyter Notebook:** EDA & preprocessing

## 🔄 **Project Steps**

### **1. Data Loading & EDA (Python)**

* Imported dataset into Jupyter Notebook
* Explored structure, summary stats, and missing values
* Visualized trends and distributions

### **2. Data Cleaning**

* Imputed missing values
* Standardized column names
* Removed redundant or unused fields
* Created new features (e.g., age groups, purchase frequency)

### **3. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server)**

* Loaded cleaned dataset into database
* Ran business-focused queries such as:

  * Revenue by gender & age group
  * High-spending discount users
  * Shipping performance
  * Subscription impact
  * Top-rated or top-selling products

### **4. Power BI Dashboard**

Built an interactive dashboard showcasing:

* KPIs (Total Customers, Avg Purchase, Avg Rating)
* Sales & Revenue by Category
* Revenue by Age Group
* Subscription Breakdown
* Filters for gender, category, shipping type, etc.

### **5. Report & Business Insights**

* Summarized findings in a structured report (Word/PDF)
* Highlighted actionable recommendations

### **6. PPT Creation (Gamma)**

* Designed a clean, story-driven presentation
* Included charts, insights, and business outcomes

---

## 📈 **Dashboard**

The Power BI dashboard visualizes:

* Key KPIs
* Customer segmentation
* Product category performance
* Purchase trends
* Subscription behavior
* Revenue distribution

(Insert dashboard image if needed)

## 🧠 **Key Results & Insights**

* Certain categories generate the highest sales
* Subscribers show higher average spending
* Young adult groups dominate purchases
* Discount usage significantly affects revenue
* Express shipping customers spend more
